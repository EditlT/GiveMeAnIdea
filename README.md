## Welcome to GiveMeAnIdea
I want to make a website with actual code for you. 
There is just one problem. 
What do I make it on? 
This is why I am asking you. I need an idea. I need your help.
This website is made with a bunch of random things as well. 
There is a google forms link down below. Submit your ideas there.

Also, there is a secret link hidden on this website. It leads to a different google forms. 
It still is an idea for a website form. But with a little twist.
Since it is a secret, first response in there I will make that website and share it will the whole class.
If you have any questions, come to me and I will answer them.

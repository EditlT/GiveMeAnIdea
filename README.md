## Welcome to GiveMeAnIdea
I want to make a website with actual code for you. 
There is just one problem. 
What do I make it on? 
This is why I am asking you. I need an idea. I need your help.
This website is made with a bunch of random things as well. 
There is a google forms link down below. Submit your ideas there.

Also, there is a secret link hidden on this website. It leads to a different google forms. 
It still is an idea for a website form. But with a little twist.
Since it is a secret, first response in there I will make that website and share it will the whole class.
If you have any questions, come to me and I will answer them.

Also, if you read the website I did say it is partially educational. When you are looking for the secret link, all of them will be google forms. All of them are math problems. Well, most of them. 

Also also, if you figure it out, ###DON'T TELL ANYBODY. 
I need you to do all of the files because I don't want people seeing it's wrong and not doing it. So, if you figure it out, fill the other files that you have not done out.

Where am I?! Oh hi, didn't see you there. My name is Tom Kenny.
Maybe you don't recognize me from my name. I'll give you a hint. [Includes Sponge]

Well, I got stuck in this.. whatever it's called. A file.
Apparently I have been ordered for you to go to this link:
https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html

It's called a binary convertor. Computers have 1 0 code in them.
If you find a 1 0 code in this file, put it in the convertor.
It'll give you something.

Anyways, fill this out to contin-
Wait, it's the last week of school. Why do they have to fill this out?!

Interface: "JUST DO WHAT I SAY."
Okay, Okay.
Tom Kenny: *whispering* "Fill this out instead, instead of the math problem file.: https://forms.gle/Jqicd1xcqNngRopU8"

Interface: " I coded you to follow me, here is the code to prove it:
01110100 01110111 01100101 01101110 01110100 01111001 00101101 01100110 01101111 01110101 01110010"

Tom Kenny: "Alright, I know."

Interface: "What is this about "instead of the math problem file." If you are going to do that, fill this out, and it's still not a math problem. Like you said.
Here's MY link: https://forms.gle/37Y7yNMbj8vt7Wfh7"

Tom Kenny: "Why don't we let the user decide which link he wants to go through. We paid a little visit in those forms."
Tom Kenny: "Good idea. User, pick your choice."

When you have picked, you are ready to go on to the next file.

## Welcome to GiveMeAnIdea
### There is an important part with this website. It says "View on Github". Do not click that until you read this paragraph. 

Now, you might be wondering, why do I need to be at this website? The reason is, I need an idea for a website (with actual code)
Also, you might hate me for this, it's also partially educational. ðŸ˜ˆ
There will me more informational stuff in the README.md file. (which ill get into later)

Here we go, here are the steps:
1. (dont do this now) Click "View on github"
2. Make sure you see where it says the README.md file. (if you dont see it then tell me) Click on it to make sure you see it.
3. Read that paragraph. I know there is a lot of reading.
4. FIND IT!!! (or if you dont then dont)

Now, you can click the button and explore.
